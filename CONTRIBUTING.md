# Contributing to Ponko

Thanks for your interest! Bug reports, benchmarks on your hardware, docs
fixes, examples and code are all welcome.

## Start with what you know

**Rust-only pull requests are welcome.** You do not need to know C or C++,
write a guide chapter, or work on unrelated subsystems to contribute a Rust
fix or feature. Small fixes, tests, examples and documentation are useful
contributions on their own. No design proposal is needed for an isolated fix.

Keep your change focused, explain the behavior in the PR, and run the checks
relevant to it. Tests for changed behavior matter; a full integration checklist
is not an entry requirement. If a check needs tools or hardware you do not
have, say so and ask for help.

Maintainers own the broader integration work: guide updates, native bindings,
paired examples and the full CI matrix. They can help in the PR or record
separate follow-ups without assigning that work to you. Compatibility of
existing APIs and bindings still needs to be preserved.

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains the detailed workflow and maintainer/agent
integration checklist; you only need the parts relevant to your contribution.

## Questions, bugs and ideas

- **Questions:** ask in [Q&A](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/discussions/categories/q-a),
  so the answer stays findable for the next person.
- **Bugs:** open an [issue](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/issues/new/choose)
  with the smallest code that shows the problem, your OS and GPU, and what
  you expected.
- **Ideas and features:** start in [Ideas](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/discussions/categories/ideas),
  or open an issue if you already have a concrete design, so we can agree on
  the shape before you write the code. The engine aims for one obvious way to
  do each thing, so a new API gets discussed before it's built.
- **Made something?** Share it in [Show and tell](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).
- **Security issues:** don't open a public issue; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Finding a manageable contribution

You do not need to understand the whole engine to fix an isolated bug, improve an
example or clarify a guide page. Start with one reproducible behavior and its tests.
Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/issues), check for an
existing assignee or active PR, and comment with the slice you want to tackle.

The ECS/rendering backlog (#132–#166) uses `help wanted`, `priority: P0` through
`priority: P3`, subsystem labels such as `area: ecs`, `area: rendering`,
`area: shaders`, `area: assets`, and `type:` labels. P0 establishes foundations;
P1 addresses high-impact limitations, P2 is useful lower-urgency work, and P3 is research. Priority is not difficulty:
this backlog has no difficulty labels. Read acceptance criteria and dependencies,
and ask for a bounded first step if the scope is unclear.

For example, [#133](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/issues/133) covers ECS
correctness tests and [#135](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/issues/135)
covers visual regressions; a focused reproducer or test case can contribute toward
either without claiming the entire issue. Performance work starts with the baselines
in [#132](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/issues/132) and
[#134](https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko/issues/134).
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) explains the sequence; verify live issue status before starting.

## Setting up

You need stable Rust (`rustup update stable`). On Linux, also install the
ALSA and udev headers for audio and gamepads
(`sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libudev-dev`). For the C++
side, you need CMake and a C++17 compiler.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ponkoengine/ponko && cd ponko
cargo test --workspace
cargo run --release --example battle
```

## Repository layout

Cargo packages use `ponko` / `ponko_*`; the old native names are gone, and legacy runtime environment variable names remain supported. Code
uses `include/ponko.h`, `include/ponko.hpp`, and `PONKO_*` settings. See
[the naming migration](book/src/naming.md) for precedence and compatibility.

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `src/` | The engine (`ponko` crate) |
| `crates/ponko_ecs` | The `ponko_ecs` ECS, usable on its own |
| `crates/ponko_macros` | Derive macros (`#[derive(Component)]`), re-exported by `ponko_ecs` and `ponko` |
| `crates/ponko_ffi` | The C API; `include/ponko.h` is generated from it |
| `include/ponko.hpp` | The header-only C++ wrapper |
| `crates/ponko_mcp` | The MCP server for AI agents |
| `crates/ponko_bench` | Benchmarks (`cargo run --release -p ponko_bench [-- filter]`) |
| `examples/`, `examples/cpp/` | Rust and C++ examples |
| `tests/`, `crates/*/tests/` | Tests, one file per area |
| `book/` | The guide ([mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)) |

## Making a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch (`fix/<topic>`, `docs/<topic>`, ...).
2. Make one focused change. Add a regression test for a bug fix or a test of
   new behavior where practical; explain any testing gap in the PR.
3. Add or adjust nearby API comments when needed to explain the behavior.
   Broader guide chapters, C/C++ bindings and paired examples are welcome but
   **not required from every contributor**. Mention follow-up needs you notice;
   maintainers will help identify and own the rest.
4. If users will notice the change, add a changelog fragment,
   `changelog.d/<pr-or-topic>.md`, instead of editing `CHANGELOG.md`
   directly (see [changelog.d/README.md](changelog.d/README.md)).
5. Run relevant checks, then open a PR to `main` describing the change and
   what you checked. It is fine to open a draft early for feedback.

### Checks: start with your change

For a Rust change, format it and run the affected package or test, for example:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test -p ponko_ecs --test queries  # an ECS query change
cargo test -p ponko --test headless    # a headless simulation change
```

For guide changes, run `mdbook build book` if mdBook is available. You do not
need a C++ toolchain for an unrelated Rust change. Report checks you could not
run; maintainers and CI cover the broader matrix before merging.

Maintainers/agents use the full integration commands in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#integration-checks), including workspace builds, tests,
Clippy, relevant native checks and Miri for affected unsafe ECS code. Required
CI must pass before merge; focused local checks do not waive compatibility,
correctness, privacy or leak checks. The exact platform/feature matrix is in
[ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml): a pull request runs quick Linux checks
(no tests: run them locally), and the tests and the full macOS/Windows/feature
matrix run on `main` after the change
lands (maintainers can add the `full-ci` label to run it on the PR first).

### Performance changes

Claims need numbers: measure in release builds before and after, and put
both in the pull request. Avoid per-frame heap allocations on hot paths.

### Breaking changes: the migration note

[STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md) promises that every break comes with what to use
instead. A change that breaks code written against the last release (a
renamed, moved or removed item, a changed signature, behaviour or default; the
semver check below finds some of them, you and the reviewer the rest) carries
its migration note in its own pull request:

- A changelog fragment with a `### Breaking changes` section
  ([changelog.d/README.md](changelog.d/README.md)). Each entry says **what
  changed**, **what to write instead**, and shows the code **before and
  after**:

  ````md
  ### Breaking changes
  - `Foo::bar` takes a `Baz` now.
    Instead: wrap the argument, `Baz::new(x)`.
    Before:
    ```rust
    foo.bar(x);
    ```
    After:
    ```rust
    foo.bar(Baz::new(x));
    ```
  ````

  `python3 scripts/changelog.py --check` (CI runs it) refuses an entry that
  lacks any of the three.
- The **`breaking` label** on the pull request. The two go together, in both
  directions: the Semver checks job fails a pull request that breaks the API
  without the label and a fragment, and fails one that has the label but no
  such fragment (the tool does not see every break, and a label is a promise
  of a migration note). Labels don't start CI, so re-run the job after
  adding one.
- **Deprecate first where it is cheap**, as STABILITY.md's "Releases" says: a
  replaced item stays for one minor as `#[deprecated(note = "use X")]` (Rust)
  or with a note in the header (C), pointing at its replacement, and the next
  minor removes it. It is cheap when the old item can forward to the new one
  without keeping a second implementation alive: a rename, a moved item, a
  method that became a builder step. It is not cheap when the old and new
  behaviour can't coexist (a changed default, a changed data layout, a type
  that gained a required field): remove it at once, with the entry above.
  Deprecating is itself a change that goes under `### Deprecated`, not
  `Breaking changes`, and names the replacement too. The removal, a minor
  later, is the change that gets the `Breaking changes` entry.

At release time `scripts/changelog.py --version X.Y.Z` folds the entries into
the **Breaking changes** block of the CHANGELOG (the short form: what changed
and what to write instead, which is also the GitHub release's notes) and writes
the same entries, with their snippets, to `book/src/migrating-to-X.Y.md`, which
it lists in `book/src/SUMMARY.md`. Nobody writes the chapter by hand. See
[Releasing](#releasing).

### Semver checks

The **Semver checks** job of CI compares the public API of every published
crate with its last release on crates.io, using
[cargo-semver-checks](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks), and
reports what a change breaks. [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md) promises that a
patch release (0.1.x) keeps code compiling that compiled against 0.1.0; this is
the check behind that promise. It is a quick check: it runs on every pull
request without the full matrix, and takes a few minutes.

- **What is checked.** `ponko`, `ponko_ecs`, `ponko_ffi`, `ponko_mcp` and
  `ponko_unity`, each with the features docs.rs builds for it
  (`[package.metadata.docs.rs]` in its Cargo.toml; not `hotpatch` or
  `bench-internals`, which are not API). A new publishable crate is picked up
  by itself. `ponko_macros` is listed as not checked: the tool reads no API
  from a proc-macro crate.
- **What fails.** On a `release-*` branch (patch releases) and on a pull request
  into one, every break fails the job. On `main`, breaks pile up until the next
  minor release, so the comparison with crates.io only reports them. What
  fails a pull request is a break *it* adds (found by comparing with the commit
  it is based on), unless it carries the **`breaking` label** *and* a
  [changelog fragment](changelog.d/README.md) with a `### Breaking changes`
  entry (what changed, what to write instead, before and after code). Both
  are needed: the label tells the reviewer, the fragment becomes the migration
  chapter. The job also fails the other way round: the label without such a
  fragment, whether or not the tool found a break.

**Reading a failure.** Open the job summary (or the log group
"before this change: <crate>"). Each failed lint has a name
(`inherent_method_missing`), a description, a link to the Cargo reference,
and a `Failed in:` list of items with the file they were in at the last release.

**Acting on it:**

1. *Undo the break* if it was not meant: keep the old item next to the new
   one and mark it `#[deprecated(note = "use ...")]`, or make the type
   `#[non_exhaustive]` before it grows. On a release branch this is the only way.
2. *Announce it* if it is meant (on `main` only): add the fragment, add the
   `breaking` label, and **re-run the Semver job**. Labels do not start CI
   (see the header of ci.yml), and the job reads the labels when it runs, so
   a re-run sees the label you added after the failure. Maintainers add the
   label; a contributor can ask for it in the pull request.
3. *Tool errors* (the job could not build a crate, or the tool does not read
   this Rust version) are not breaks and no label excuses them. See the note at
   the top of the job in ci.yml about the pinned tool and Rust versions.

To run it locally, with the same pinned tool (`cargo install --locked
cargo-semver-checks --version 0.51.0`; it needs the Linux audio and udev headers
the other builds need):

```sh
EVENT=pull_request BASE_REF=main BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD) \
  python3 scripts/semver-checks.py run
```

Without a pull request number it finds no label, so it fails a break that has
no label; the output says what it would need. For one crate,
`cargo semver-checks check-release -p ponko_unity --default-features --release-type minor`
shows the lints directly.

**What it does not catch.** The tool compares the public API as rustdoc
describes it, with a fixed list of lints (`cargo semver-checks check-release
--list`); a break no lint describes passes. Know these gaps when you review:

- Behaviour with an unchanged signature: a different result, panic, default
  value, ordering, timing, or determinism; what a saved world or a
  save file contains; the fields of the control endpoint and MCP messages.
- Many type changes in fields, parameters and return values, and tightened
  generic bounds, are covered only where a lint exists for them.
- Features outside the checked set (`hotpatch`, `bench-internals`) and
  platform-specific API on other targets: only the Linux target with the
  docs.rs features is built.
- The C and C++ headers (`include/`) and the layout of `#[repr(C)]` types as
  C sees them: the tool reads the Rust side of `ponko_ffi` only. The C ABI tests
  and `scripts/check-ffi-coverage.py` are what guard the header.
- Anything behind `#[doc(hidden)]` (such as `ponko::__ffi`), which is
  unstable by definition, and a new crate's first release (nothing to compare).
- Proc-macro crates (`ponko_macros`): the names and attributes of the derives
  are not compared.
- Dependencies: when a public type from `glam`, `wgpu` or another crate in our
  API changes major version, our API breaks without a lint saying so.

## Architecture proposals

Read [PROJECT_VISION.md](PROJECT_VISION.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md),
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md) for the affected work.
Discuss major changes in an issue before implementing them. Describe the problem,
a small proposed interface, ownership and dependency boundaries, alternatives,
compatibility/platform effects and validation plan. Explain why a new abstraction,
crate or dependency is better than a smaller internal change.

The aim is modular internals with an integrated public experience. Keep ordinary
`Game`/`Ctx` workflows usable, preserve optional features and headless operation,
and avoid unrelated rewrites. The proposed parallel system scheduler remains
optional; it needs sound access boundaries and explicit ordering/determinism rules,
never concurrent unrestricted mutable access to `Ctx` or `World`.

## Reproductions and GPU evidence

A useful bug report includes a minimal runnable example or failing test, commands,
engine revision, Rust version, feature flags, expected and actual results, and logs.
For nondeterministic failures, include the seed or input sequence when available.
For rendering, add OS, GPU/driver/backend, resolution and quality settings, plus
screenshots when safe to share. Never attach private project assets or secrets.

For GPU changes, run relevant offscreen/visual tests and inspect comparable
before/after images. Exercise capability fallbacks and resize/history behavior
when affected. Record skipped tests and unsupported adapters; a headless logic
test does not establish rendering correctness. If hardware is unavailable, say
which validation is missing in the PR so reviewers can help.

The offscreen GPU suites live in `src/render/*_render_test.rs`. Their shared
conventions (getting the adapter with a logged skip reason, tolerance-based image
comparison and semantic pixel checks, reference images with metadata under
`tests/fixtures/render/`) are documented in `src/render/render_test_support.rs`.
Run them with `cargo test -p ponko --lib --features 3d render_test -- --nocapture`
and report which ran and which logged `render test SKIPPED`. Reference images are
only rewritten with `PONKO_UPDATE_REFERENCES=1` (refused in CI); a regenerated
reference needs the before/after images in the PR.

Performance PRs should record the revision, commands, toolchain, features, hardware,
workload, warm-up and comparable before/after results. Include CPU and GPU times,
frame-time percentiles, memory and allocations where relevant, and identify metrics
that could not be collected. Verify correctness independently; never generalize
one benchmark into an overall engine ranking.

## Dependency audit

[`deny.toml`](deny.toml) holds the policy that [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny)
checks: allowed licenses, security advisories (the RustSec database), banned
and duplicate crates, and allowed sources (crates.io only). The workflow
`.github/workflows/deny.yml` runs it on pull requests that change `Cargo.toml`,
`Cargo.lock` or `deny.toml`, and every Monday on `main`, where a new advisory
opens (or updates) one issue, "Dependency audit: security advisories found by
the weekly run", and the issue closes when the audit is clean again. The
workflow is not part of the **CI passed** check (a path-filtered check can't be
required), so read its result on the pull request.

Run it yourself before you touch dependencies:

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-deny --version 0.20.2   # once; CI pins the same version
cargo deny --locked check -D warnings
```

When it fails, the output names the crate and the dependency chain that
brought it in:

- **A license is not allowed** (`licenses`). Prefer a dependency with an
  allowed license. The list in `deny.toml` is what the C library's
  third-party notices can carry; adding a license is a maintainer decision:
  say in the pull request why it is acceptable for the release archives.
  A crate that declares no license is refused by the notices too.
- **An advisory** (`advisories`: vulnerability, unmaintained, unsound or
  yanked). Update the dependency, with the smallest bump that fixes it
  (`cargo update -p <crate>`; `cargo tree -i <crate>` shows who needs it), and
  run the full checks. If nothing fixed exists, add an `ignore` entry to
  `deny.toml` with the advisory id and a `reason`: how we reach the crate and
  why that is acceptable, and what ends the exception. Never ignore without a
  reason.
- **A duplicate version** (`bans`). Align versions when you can (a newer
  release of the parent, or `cargo update`). A duplicate a dependency we don't
  control forces gets a `skip` entry with a `reason` naming the dependency
  that needs the old version. Don't skip a duplicate caused by our own
  requirements: update those.
- **A banned crate or a source that is not crates.io.** Both are deliberate:
  the release archives must not need a system TLS stack, and releases build
  from crates.io alone. Change the policy only with a maintainer's agreement.
- **A stale exception** (a warning, an error with `-D warnings`): the
  `skip` or `ignore` entry matches nothing any more. Delete it.

A weekly advisory issue is handled the same way: fix, or ignore with a reason,
in a pull request that links the issue.

## Using coding agents

Coding agents are welcome under the same contribution rules. You remain responsible
for understanding and reviewing their changes, verifying APIs and dependencies,
running the required checks, and keeping the change scoped. Use existing MCP tools
for runtime inspection, screenshots, stepping or profiling when helpful; retain
reproducible commands/tests and explain what the evidence establishes. Do not treat
agent narration as proof. Report incomplete work, test skips and platform limitations,
and distinguish implemented behavior from proposals. Keep private code and assets
out of public submissions and external services.

## Releasing

For maintainers. A release is a version tag; `.github/workflows/release.yml`
does the rest, so the tag, the crates on crates.io and the CHANGELOG section
always come from one commit. Never run `cargo publish` by hand.

1. Fold the fragments in: `python3 scripts/changelog.py --version X.Y.Z`
   (`--dry-run` shows the result first). If any fragment breaks the API, this
   also writes the migration chapter, `book/src/migrating-to-X.Y.md` (named
   after the minor: `migrating-to-0.2.md` for 0.2.0 and its candidates), from
   the same entries and lists it in `book/src/SUMMARY.md`; read it, then check
   the book (`mdbook build book`). A patch release may not carry breaking
   entries. In `CHANGELOG.md`,
   add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` heading above the folded content and
   rename the folded one to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`; point the
   `[Unreleased]` link at `compare/vX.Y.Z...HEAD` and add `[X.Y.Z]` beside it.
   The section becomes the GitHub release's notes, which hold at most
   125,000 characters: summarize, and keep long lists in the guide.
2. Set `version = "X.Y.Z"` in the root `Cargo.toml` and in every published
   `crates/*/Cargo.toml` (`ponko_bench` is `publish = false`), including the
   `version = "..."` requirements the crates put on each other, and refresh
   `Cargo.lock` (`cargo check --workspace`).
3. `python3 scripts/release-check.py check vX.Y.Z` lists what still disagrees
   (it does not need the tag to exist), and `cargo publish --workspace
   --dry-run` packages and builds every crate the way crates.io will. Open the
   pull request with the `full-ci` label, let CI pass and merge it.
4. Tag the merge commit on `main` and push the tag:

   ```sh
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Ponko X.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   The workflow is kept disabled between releases: enable it
   (`gh workflow enable release.yml`) after the release pull request merged
   and before pushing the tag. It builds the C library on each OS (with the
   headers, the licenses and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` for every library
   linked into it), packages every crate (`cargo publish --workspace
   --dry-run`), creates the GitHub release from the CHANGELOG section, and
   publishes the crates to crates.io if the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret is
   set (otherwise that job says so and can be re-run once it is). Its first
   job, `verify`, runs `release-check.py check`, and every other job waits for
   it: nothing is built, released or published unless the tag is `vX.Y.Z` on a
   commit merged to `main`, every crate is at X.Y.Z, `CHANGELOG.md` has a
   non-empty `## [X.Y.Z]` section that fits in a release body, a release
   whose section has **Breaking changes** is a minor one with its migration
   chapter written, listed in the book's summary and holding every entry, the
   sub-crates carry the root license files and no fragment is left over. (It does not
   look at CI: tag a commit whose CI on `main` passed.)
5. Redeploy the website (https://ponko.dev/), which builds the guide from
   `main` (its own repository, `ponkoengine/ponko-website`). The API
   reference of the release appears on docs.rs by itself.

`.github/workflows/release-audit.yml` runs weekly (and on demand) and fails if
a version of our crates on crates.io has no matching tag, which is what a
publish outside the workflow looks like (`python3 scripts/release-check.py
published` does the same locally). To fix it, tag the commit the crate was
published from. Its sha is in the `.crate` file:

```sh
curl -L https://static.crates.io/crates/ponko/ponko-X.Y.Z.crate | tar -xzOf - ponko-X.Y.Z/.cargo_vcs_info.json
git tag vX.Y.Z <that sha> && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

`0.0.1` was published by hand from the last commit of #167 before it was
squash-merged; its tag `v0.0.1` is on the squash commit, whose tree differs
only in repository URLs and docs wording.
