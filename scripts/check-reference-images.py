"""Checks the render tests' reference images, and gathers the evidence a
reviewer needs when a change touches them.

The references live in tests/fixtures/render: a small PNG and its metadata
(<name>.json) per image, written only by a test run with
PONKO_UPDATE_REFERENCES=1 (see src/render/render_test_support.rs and the
book's "GPU regression tests").

    check-reference-images.py
        Every image has metadata and the other way round, the metadata is
        complete, its checksum is the PNG's, and the images are small.

    check-reference-images.py --changed BASE [--evidence DIR] [--summary FILE]
        Also lists the references that differ from the git revision BASE
        (added, changed or removed). Each must come with changed metadata
        and a reason. With --evidence, writes the before and after images
        and a page showing them side by side to DIR; with --summary,
        appends a Markdown table to FILE (a CI job summary). Prints
        `changed=<n>` last.

    check-reference-images.py --review --repo R --pr N --label L ...
        CI's review gate for a pull request that changes references: passes
        when the pull request carries the label and the label is not older
        than the push that last changed them. A stale label is taken off.
        Needs the gh CLI and a token (GH_TOKEN).

    check-reference-images.py --self-test
        Runs the script's own checks on made-up folders.

Uses only the standard library and git.
