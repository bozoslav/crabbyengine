//! Sound before the player's first click on the web.

//! such gesture ([`Gate::open`]). What the game asked for before it waits
//! here: looping sounds (music, ambience) start once sound is allowed, and
//! one-shots are dropped, since a click or footstep heard seconds late
//! would be out of place. On the desktop the gate starts open and never
