//! The restricted view a declared system gets instead of `&mut Ctx`:
//! [`SystemView`], for systems that take it ([`Game::add`](crate::game::Game::add)).
//!
//! A view system can reach only what its [`SystemAccess`] declares. The
//! world part is a [`WorldView`] (declared components and resources, no
//! structural changes). Events, commands and services are fields with the
//! names `Ctx` has (`sys.events`, `sys.commands`, `sys.input`, `sys.time`,
//! ...), each behind a handle that checks the declaration on every use, in
//! every build. There is no path from a `SystemView` to the rest of `Ctx`,
//! so a declaration can't be wrong in a way that goes unnoticed: what isn't
//! declared panics when it is used, naming the system.
//!
//! A view system runs in one of two ways, with the same results. Alone, it
//! borrows what it declared from `Ctx`. In a parallel batch
//! ([`Game::parallel_systems`](crate::game::Game::parallel_systems)) it shares the
//! world with the batch's other systems and gets its own command buffer and
//! an outbox for its events, both delivered when the batch ends.

///
/// - [`world`](Self::world): the declared components and resources (see
///   [`WorldView`]). Spawning, despawning, inserting and removing
///   components go through [`commands`](Self::commands).
/// - [`events`](Self::events): declared event types.
/// - Services, each a field named as on `Ctx` and behind its declaration
///   ([`ViewService`]): [`input`](Self::input) and [`time`](Self::time)
///   (read), [`audio`](Self::audio), the cameras, the
///   [`spatial`](Self::spatial) grid (read), the physics worlds and
///   lockstep networking ([`net.lockstep`](ViewNet::lockstep)). Drawing, UI, assets and profiling stay on `Ctx`
///   systems.
/// - The shortcuts `Ctx` has for those services: [`dt`](Self::dt),

///   [`key_released`](Self::key_released), [`mouse_pos`](Self::mouse_pos),
///   [`play_sound`](Self::play_sound) and [`random`](Self::random).
